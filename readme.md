TurboQuake (formerly 486Quake)
========
Quake with the turbo button pressed
-----------------------------------


this repository contains TurboQuake, a fork of the original Quake sources that
targets older era-appropriate hardware from around and in the years after the
time of Quake's release - including restored support for MS-DOS.

TurboQuake does not currently add substantial functionality or bugfixes over the
original Quake release. instead, it focuses on further optimizing the engine, 
and re-optimizing portions of it to run better on other platforms.

TurboQuake has specific assembly optimizations for Intel 486, Pentium, and Cyrix
486 processors, and most other x86-compatible processors will work with at least
one of these builds.

Non-x86 processors are also well-supported, but do not currently have assembly
optimizations. There are numerous renderer engine optimizations in TurboQuake 
that still apply to these platforms.

building
========

on a unix-like host machine with a djgpp cross-compiler, source djgpp's environment script.

then, from this source directory, you can just run

    make

this will build the standard TurboQuake binary by default.

to build all binaries, you can run the `build_all.sh` script.

advanced build options
======================

you can pass the following options to `make` to change parameters of the build:

OLEVEL: optimization level passed to compiler. defaults to "-O3".
OCPU: CPU target. valid options are "386, 486, cx4, 586, mmx, 686". defaults to 486.
OLTO: controls whether LTO is used. defaults to "yes", any other value means no.
OASM: controls whether hand-written assembly is used. defaults to "yes", any other value means no.
OSTRIP: strip options passed to compiler. defaults to "-s".

results
=======

the following tables list some older known results for TurboQuake on different 
machines. there is wide variation between different boards even with the same 
cpu, so bear that in mind.

these benchmarks are all taken with default screen size and rendering settings.
